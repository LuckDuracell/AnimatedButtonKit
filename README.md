## Usage

AnimatedButton Declaration vs Button Declaration

```
import SwiftUI
import AnimatedButtonKit

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
    
        AnimatedButton(animation: .rotate, icon: "gear") {
            print("neat action!")
        } label: { icon in
            icon
                .padding(5)
                .background(.regularMaterial)
                .font(.title)
        }
        
        Button {
            print("neat action!")
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "gear")
                .padding(5)
                .background(.regularMaterial)
                .font(.title)
        }
    }
}
```

Custom Icon rather than SFSymbol

```
import SwiftUI
import AnimatedButtonKit

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
    
        AnimatedButton(animation: .rotate, image: Image(.yourIconHere)) {
            print("neat action!")
        } label: { icon in
            icon
                .resizeable()
                .scaledToFit()
                .frame(width: 30, height: 30)
                .background(.regularMaterial)
        }
        
        Button {
            print("neat action!")
        } label: {
            Image(.yourIconHere)
                .resizeable()
                .scaledToFit()
                .frame(width: 30, height: 30)
                .background(.regularMaterial)
        }
    }
}
```

## Using Presets

### Examples

### Animation Preset Values

|üóÉÔ∏è Preset|üî¢ Value|üóÇÔ∏è Parameters|
|---------|--------|--------|
|.rotate |Rotates 360 degrees on button press     |No parameters needed! |
|.flip  |Rotates 180 degrees on button press     |No parameters needed! |
|.bounce  |Bounces the passed Y amount then back     |_ amount = -5: The distance to slide up/down before sliding back to offset of zero |
|.slide |Slides the passed X amount then back     |_ amount = 5: The distance to slide left/right before sliding back to offset of zero |
|.squish |Compresses the shape vertically by the passed proportion from 0 to 1|_ amount: The proportion (some value from 0 to 1) that the shape gets vertically compressed before returning to original size. <br><br>  makeWider = false: Determines whether or not the shape should get to sell the visual that the icon is being squished |
